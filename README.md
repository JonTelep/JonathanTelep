# Jonathan Telep
Hello, I am Jonathan Telep. I am currently a consultant at Infoverity leveraging real-time solutions to help industries master the art of enterprise data management. 

## Overview
I wanted to familiarize myself with ReactJS while showing some of my projects to the world. In this repository you can expect to find my contact profiles, interests, hobbies, articles, and maybe some tech blogs. I created this purely for personal practice in web development as well as a way to find people with similar interests as me. I will be actively updating the site with what I'm working on, future plans and ideas that I would like to collaborate with others on.

## Contributing
As this is my personal website I do not see contributions from others necessary. If a project comes up that collaboration will be needed, an additional repository will be made to house the project. The reason I have this repository public is to display my code for people to view how I've developed one thing or another. All feedback is welcome. I can be reached at Telepjonathan@gmail.com or leave a message at www.JonathanTelep.com/contact , thanks!
