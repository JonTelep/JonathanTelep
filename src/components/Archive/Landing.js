<h3>Ethereum and Solidity</h3>
<p>
    I've always wanted to be on the front lines of technology and I truly believe that blockchain and web3 will revolutionize the way everyone interacts through the internet. In my spare
    time I've been working on learning Blockchain development with <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/">CryptoZombies.</a> An interactive way to create your first blockchain DApp with
    smart contracts in Solidity. I am also enrolled in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide">ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide </a>
    to help me get a better understanding and have a couple projects under my belt to reference for my future projects.
</p>
<p>
    I've also started interacting and reading from many popular crypto people.
